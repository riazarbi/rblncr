\title{Load environment variables from the specified file}
\usage{
load_dot_env(file = ".env")
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The name of the file to use.}
}
\description{
Load variables defined in the given file, as environment
variables.
}
\details{
The file is parsed line by line, and line is expected
to have one of the following formats:
\preformatted{VARIABLE=value
VARIABLE2="quoted value"
VARIABLE3='another quoted variable'
# Comment line
export EXPORTED="exported variable"
export EXPORTED2=another}

In more details:
\itemize{
\item A leading \code{export} is ignored, to keep the file
compatible with Unix shells.
\item No whitespace is allowed right before or after the
equal sign, again, to promote compatilibity with Unix shells.
\item No multi-line variables are supported currently. The
file is strictly parsed line by line.
\item Unlike for Unix shells, unquoted values are \emph{not}
terminated by whitespace.
\item Comments start with \code{#}, without any leading
whitespace. You cannot mix variable definitions and
comments in the same line.
\item Empty lines (containing whitespace only) are ignored.
}

It is suggested to keep the file in a form that is parsed the
same way with \code{dotenv} and \code{bash} (or other shells).

# Load from a file
